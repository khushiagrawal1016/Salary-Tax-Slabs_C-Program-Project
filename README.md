The slabs are as follows:
   1. For income less than ₹250000 LPA, there's no tax imposed.
   2. For income between ₹250000-500000 LPA, 5% tax.
   3. For income between ₹500000-750000 LPA, 10% tax.
   4. For income between ₹750000-1000000 LPA, 15% tax.
   5. For income between ₹1000000-1250000 LPA, 20% tax.
   6. For income between ₹1250000-1500000 LPA, 25% tax.
   7. For income greater than ₹1500000 LPA, 30% tax.

The C program reads the Annual Income of an employee as input from the user and calculates the tax imposed on the same.
It then prints the Total Tax and hence Net Salary after Tax Deduction.
